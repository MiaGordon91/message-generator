# Birthday Message Generator
After completing an online React tutorial, I started this side project to put my learnings into practice.

I have built a React frontend with a Node Express backend that communicates with OpenAI.

## How the app works
A user can select from a number of of predefined recipient buttons, which represent family members and friends.
Once the user clicks a button, it then generates a message and populates this within the input field. This is essentially an action to write a birthday message for the selected recipient. 
Once the user clicks the send icon, the message is then sent as part of a request to ChatGPT and a response is rendered on the UI to the user.

## Technologies used include:
React, Typescript, NodeJS, ExpressJS, Vite, Chakra UI, Cors, Nodemon, OpenAI
